-If You Want Threepole To Work Install The Setup In The Default Directory When Installing Threepole

## Setting up the ports folder
- You must put the ports folder inside of your Documents folder which should be located inside of C:\Users\Your PC Username\Documents

## Keybinds
-Comes with no Binds set. Press F11 to bind what you want binded.

-Press F11 default to open the binds menu. In this menu you can fully customize all of the keysbinds. If you don't want a bind put "<>" there instead to null the bind. Use [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) for help with making keybinds using multiple characters including shift control or alt. 

-For the Macros to work you need to set your airmove and super key along with your finisher key in the binds menu.
## Important Note
- If you do not setup the ports folder inside of the documents folder than the limiter wont work for ports 
- You must have Siva.exe and settings.ini inside of the same folder/location or the application will just not work since there isnt any keybinds set
