## Setting up the ports folder
- You must put the ports folder inside of your Documents folder which should be located inside of C:\Users\Your PC Username\Documents

## Keybinds
-Press F4 Default To See All The Keybinds, If you would like to change them open the Arcite Folder and open settings.ini and [this](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) edit the keybinds. There should be a message with which each one does to help change the correct one.
## Important Note
- If you do not setup the ports folder inside of the documents folder than the limiter wont work for ports 
- You must have Arcite.exe and settings.ini inside of the same folder/location or the application will just not work since there isnt any keybinds set
